    emergency_keywords = {
        'fire': 'fire', 'medical': 'medical', 'emergency': 'general',
        'critical': 'critical', 'urgent': 'urgent'
    }
    # Simple string matching - easy to understand for students
    for keyword, emergency_type in emergency_keywords.items():
        if keyword.lower() in str(job_info).lower():
            return True, emergency_type
    return False, None

```python
@self.fastapi_app.get("/broker/vector-clock")
def get_vector_clock():
    """Simple endpoint to check current vector clock state"""
    return {
        "node_id": str(self.executor_broker.node_id),
        "clock_state": self.executor_broker.vector_clock.clock,
        "current_time": self.executor_broker.vector_clock.get_logical_time()
    }
```
