## Application to Our Implementation

### Vector Clock Foundation (Task 1)
Our vector clock implementation draws primarily from Lamport (1978) and Fidge (1988) for the core algorithms, with modern distributed systems practices from Tanenbaum & Van Steen (2016) for the educational approach.

### Broker Integration (Task 2)
The broker integration leverages fault tolerance concepts from Schneider (1990) and communication reliability from Birman & Joseph (1987) to ensure robust job distribution.

### Emergency Response System (Task 3)
The emergency response implementation combines distributed computing patterns from Zhang et al. (2019) with real-world emergency management principles from FEMA and ISO standards to create a practical, educational emergency response system.

### Code Quality and Education
Following Beck (2002) for test-driven development and Fowler (2018) for clean code principles, the implementation prioritizes educational value while maintaining professional software development standards.
