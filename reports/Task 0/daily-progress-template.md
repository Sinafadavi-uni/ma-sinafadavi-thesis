### **🔍 Code Quality Checks (Per Stage)**

#### **Stage-by-Stage Quality Gates**
- **Stage 1 Quality**: 
  - [ ] Linting passed
  - [ ] Type checking passed  
  - [ ] Documentation complete
  - [ ] Tests written and passing
  - [ ] Code review (self-review) completed
  
- **Stage 2 Quality**: 
  - [ ] All Stage 1 checks still pass
  - [ ] New code meets quality standards
  - [ ] Integration with Stage 1 tested
  
- **Stage 3 Quality**: 
  - [ ] All previous stages still pass
  - [ ] Complete functionality tested
  - [ ] Ready for next day's work

#### **Daily Quality Summary**
- **Overall Linting**: ✅/❌
- **Overall Type Checking**: ✅/❌  
- **Overall Documentation**: ✅/❌
- **All Stages Tested**: ✅/❌
- **Git Commit**: ✅/❌ (only after all stages complete and tested)

### **⚠️ Stage Gate Rules**
1. **No Stage 2 until Stage 1 is fully tested and passing**
2. **No Stage 3 until Stage 2 is fully tested and passing**  
3. **No Git commit until ALL stages for the day are complete and tested**
4. **No proceeding to next day until current day is fully validated**

### **🚫 Blocker Protocol**
- **Stage Blocked**: If any stage fails testing, STOP and fix before proceeding
- **Day Blocked**: If daily objectives cannot be completed with passing tests, document and plan recovery
- **Escalation**: Major blockers require plan adjustment in next day's preparation

### **📈 Overall Progress**
- **Day Rating**: [1-5 stars] ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Plan Adherence**: [On track/Ahead/Behind]
- **Energy Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Notes**: [Any additional observations]
