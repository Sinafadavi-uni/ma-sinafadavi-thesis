**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Author**: Sina Fadavi  
**Thesis Focus**: Vector Clock-Based Causal Consistency for Emergency/Disaster Response Computing  

## Overview

This literature review examines the foundational and contemporary research in vector clocks, distributed systems, and their applications to emergency computing scenarios. The review focuses on papers relevant to our thesis topic: **"Vector Clock-Based Causal Consistency in Distributed Emergency Computing"**.

## 1. Foundational Papers

### 1.1 Lamport's Seminal Work (1978)

**Paper**: "Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System"  
**Author**: Leslie Lamport  
**Publication**: Communications of the ACM, Vol. 21, No. 7, pp. 558-565  
**DOI**: 10.1145/359545.359563  
**Citations**: 6,636+ (as of 2025)

#### Key Contributions:
- **Happened-Before Relation**: Established the fundamental concept of causal ordering in distributed systems
- **Logical Clocks**: Introduced scalar logical timestamps to capture partial ordering of events
- **Clock Consistency Condition**: If event a → b (happened-before), then C(a) < C(b)
- **Synchronization Algorithm**: Provided distributed algorithm for maintaining logical time

#### Core Concepts:
1. **Partial Ordering**: Events in distributed systems follow a partial (not total) ordering
2. **Causal Dependencies**: Messages create causal relationships between processes
3. **Logical Time**: Time abstracted from physical clocks to focus on event ordering

#### Relevance to Our Thesis:
- Provides theoretical foundation for all vector clock work
- Establishes importance of causal ordering in distributed coordination
- Demonstrates that logical time is sufficient for many distributed algorithms

#### Limitations Addressed by Vector Clocks:
- Scalar clocks cannot determine concurrency vs. causality
- Cannot fully capture causal relationships in multi-process systems
- Insufficient for complex distributed consistency protocols

---

### 1.2 Vector Clock Foundations (1988)

**Papers**: 
- Colin Fidge: "Timestamps in message-passing systems that preserve the partial ordering"
- Friedemann Mattern: "Virtual Time and Global States of Distributed Systems"

#### Key Contributions:
- **Vector Time**: Extension of Lamport clocks to vectors for full causal ordering
- **Mathematical Properties**: Formal definition of vector clock comparison operators
- **Concurrent Event Detection**: Ability to distinguish between causal and concurrent events

#### Vector Clock Algorithm:
```
Initialization: VC[i] = 0 for all processes
Local Event: VC[i]++
Send Message: VC[i]++; send(message, VC)
Receive Message: VC[k] = max(VC[k], received_VC[k]) for all k; VC[i]++
```

#### Causal Ordering Properties:
- **Antisymmetry**: if VC(a) < VC(b), then ¬(VC(b) < VC(a))
- **Transitivity**: if VC(a) < VC(b) and VC(b) < VC(c), then VC(a) < VC(c)
- **Concurrency Detection**: VC(a) || VC(b) iff neither VC(a) < VC(b) nor VC(b) < VC(a)
