**Project**: Vector Clock-Based Causal Consistency for Data Replication in Urban Computing Platforms  
**Author**: Sina Fadavi  
**Date**: August 8, 2025  

## üéØ **Core Files Dependency Order (Essential Only)**

This document provides the **exact priority order** for coding the essential files needed to implement the core thesis idea: "Vector Clock-Based Causal Consistency for Data Replication". Only the absolutely necessary files are included - no tests, documentation, or auxiliary files.

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Must Code First)**

### **1. `rec/algorithms/vector_clock.py` - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Why First**: This is the absolute foundation. Everything depends on this.

**What to implement**:
```python
# Core VectorClock class implementing Lamport's algorithm
# EmergencyLevel enum and create_emergency() function
# The heart of your entire thesis idea
```

**Key Components**:
- `VectorClock` class with `tick()`, `update()`, `compare()` methods
- `EmergencyLevel` enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- `create_emergency()` function for emergency context creation
- Lamport's vector clock algorithm implementation

**Dependencies**: None (foundation file)

---

### **2. `rec/algorithms/causal_message.py` - CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**
**Why Second**: Vector clocks are useless without message passing.

**What to implement**:
```python
# CausalMessage class for distributed communication
# Carries vector clock state between nodes
# Essential for any distributed operation
```

**Key Components**:
- `CausalMessage` class for distributed communication
- Message payload with vector clock state
- Serialization/deserialization for network transmission

**Dependencies**: Requires `rec/algorithms/vector_clock.py`

---

### **3. `rec/consistency/causal_consistency.py` - CORE LOGIC**
**Why Third**: Implements the actual "Causal Consistency" part of your idea.

**What to implement**:
```python
# CausalConsistencyManager - coordinates vector clock operations
# FCFSConsistencyPolicy - enforces First-Come-First-Serve with causality
# This IS your thesis contribution
```

**Key Components**:
- `CausalConsistencyManager` class for consistency coordination
- `FCFSConsistencyPolicy` class for First-Come-First-Serve policy
- Causal ordering verification and enforcement
- Data replication consistency guarantees

**Dependencies**: Requires `rec/algorithms/vector_clock.py`, `rec/algorithms/causal_message.py`

---

## **Phase 2: Node Implementation Layer**

### **4. `rec/nodes/emergency_executor.py` - FIRST EXECUTOR**
**Why Fourth**: Simplest executor implementation to validate concepts.

**What to implement**:
```python
# SimpleEmergencyExecutor - basic emergency-aware job processing
# Proves vector clocks work with emergency scenarios
# Educational foundation before complexity
```

**Key Components**:
- `SimpleEmergencyExecutor` class for emergency-aware job processing
- Emergency mode activation and deactivation
- Priority-based job handling with vector clock integration
- Basic job queuing and execution with causal ordering

**Dependencies**: Requires all Phase 1 files

---

### **5. `rec/nodes/enhanced_vector_clock_executor.py` - DATA REPLICATION CORE**
**Why Fifth**: This implements the actual "Data Replication" part.

**What to implement**:
```python
# VectorClockFCFSExecutor - FCFS policy with causal consistency
# Core data replication logic with first-wins policy
# Direct implementation of your thesis title
```

**Key Components**:
- `VectorClockFCFSExecutor` class implementing FCFS policy
- Result submission handling with causal consistency
- First-wins conflict resolution mechanism
- Data replication consistency enforcement

**Dependencies**: Requires all Phase 1 files + `rec/nodes/emergency_executor.py`

---

## **Phase 3: Coordination Layer**

### **6. `rec/nodes/brokers/vector_clock_broker.py` - BROKER COORDINATION**
**Why Sixth**: Brokers coordinate multiple executors with vector clocks.

**What to implement**:
```python
# VectorClockBroker - distributor with causal awareness
# VectorClockExecutorBroker - UCP integration point
# Essential for multi-node scenarios
```

**Key Components**:
- `VectorClockBroker` class for causal-aware job distribution
- `VectorClockExecutorBroker` class for UCP integration
- Multi-executor coordination with vector clock synchronization
- Emergency-aware job routing and coordination

**Dependencies**: Requires all previous files (Phases 1-2)

---

### **7. `rec/integration/emergency_integration.py` - SYSTEM COORDINATION**
**Why Seventh**: Ties everything together in emergency scenarios.

**What to implement**:
```python
# SimpleEmergencySystem - complete emergency response coordination
# Demonstrates vector clocks + causal consistency + emergency response
# Proves your complete thesis concept works
```

**Key Components**:
- `SimpleEmergencySystem` class for complete system coordination
- Multi-executor emergency response coordination
- System-wide emergency mode activation
- End-to-end demonstration of thesis concept

**Dependencies**: Requires all previous files (Phases 1-3)

---

## üéØ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Start with File #1, Test Immediately**
```python
# After coding vector_clock.py, test it works:
from rec.algorithms.vector_clock import VectorClock
clock = VectorClock("test")
clock.tick()
print(f"Clock state: {clock.clock}")  # Should work
```

### **Add Each File Incrementally**
```python
# After each file, test the integration:
# File 1 + 2: Test vector clock + message passing
# File 1 + 2 + 3: Test causal consistency
# File 1-4: Test emergency executor
# File 1-5: Test FCFS data replication
# File 1-6: Test broker coordination  
# File 1-7: Test complete emergency system
```

### **Critical Dependencies**
- **Files 1-3**: Must work perfectly before continuing
- **Files 4-5**: Core executors implementing your thesis
- **Files 6-7**: System integration proving end-to-end functionality

## üèÜ **Success Criteria**

After implementing these 7 core files, you should be able to:

1. **Create vector clocks** and perform basic operations (tick, update, compare)
2. **Send causal messages** between distributed nodes
3. **Enforce causal consistency** with FCFS policy for data replication
4. **Handle emergency scenarios** with priority-based job execution
5. **Coordinate multiple executors** through vector clock-aware brokers
6. **Demonstrate end-to-end system** with emergency response coordination

This is the **minimum viable implementation** of your thesis idea. Everything else is enhancement, optimization, or additional features.
