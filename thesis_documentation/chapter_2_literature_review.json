    "vector_clocks": "Lamport's vector clock algorithm provides a mechanism for determining causal\nrelationships in distributed systems. The algorithm maintains logical timestamps\nthat preserve causality, enabling consistent ordering of events across distributed\nnodes without requiring global synchronization.",
    "causal_consistency": "Causal consistency ensures that operations that are causally related are seen\nby all processes in the same order. This consistency model is particularly\nimportant in distributed systems where strong consistency is impractical but\ncausality must be preserved.",
    "urban_computing": "Urban Computing Platforms provide computational infrastructure for smart city\napplications, handling diverse workloads from IoT sensors, mobile devices,\nand urban services. These platforms require robust data management and\ncoordination mechanisms."
