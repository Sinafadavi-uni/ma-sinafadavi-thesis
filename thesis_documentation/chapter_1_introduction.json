  "problem_statement": "Urban Computing Platforms (UCP) face significant challenges in data replication,\nparticularly in emergency response scenarios where consistency and coordination\nare critical. Existing UCP implementations lack robust causal consistency\nmechanisms, leading to potential data inconsistencies during distributed\noperations. The UCP Part B requirements specify the need for enhanced data\nreplication capabilities that current systems do not adequately address.",
  "research_questions": [
    "How can vector clock-based causal consistency improve UCP data replication?",
    "What are the performance implications of vector clock integration in UCP?",
    "How can emergency response scenarios benefit from causal consistency?",
    "What fault tolerance mechanisms are required for production UCP deployment?"
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "Implement vector clock-based causal consistency in UCP",
    "Develop emergency-aware coordination mechanisms",
    "Achieve complete UCP Part B compliance",
    "Optimize performance for production deployment",
    "Provide comprehensive fault tolerance framework",
    "Validate implementation through academic benchmarking"
  ],
  "thesis_scope": "This thesis focuses on implementing vector clock-based causal consistency\nfor the Urban Computing Platform, specifically addressing UCP Part B\nrequirements. The scope includes broker-executor coordination, emergency\nresponse integration, performance optimization, and comprehensive validation.\nThe implementation provides a complete, production-ready solution with\nextensive documentation and academic validation.",
