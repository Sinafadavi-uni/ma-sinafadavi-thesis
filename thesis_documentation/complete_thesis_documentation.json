    "summary": "This thesis presents a novel approach to data replication in Urban Computing Platforms \nusing vector clock-based causal consistency. The research addresses critical limitations \nin existing UCP data replication mechanisms by implementing Lamport's vector clock \nalgorithm enhanced for emergency response scenarios.\n\nThe implementation extends the UCP broker-executor architecture with vector clock \ncoordination, enabling causal consistency while maintaining first-come-first-served \n(FCFS) policies. The system provides comprehensive emergency response capabilities \nwith priority-based job execution and fault tolerance mechanisms.\n\nKey contributions include: (1) First vector clock integration with Urban Computing \nPlatform, (2) Novel emergency-aware vector clock coordination, (3) Production-ready \nUCP Part B compliance implementation, (4) Comprehensive performance optimization and \nfault tolerance framework, and (5) Complete academic validation with demonstration system.\n\nThe evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in data consistency, emergency \nresponse coordination, and system reliability. Performance benchmarks show efficient \nvector clock operations with minimal overhead. The implementation successfully addresses \nall UCP Part B requirements while providing a foundation for future distributed urban \ncomputing research.",
