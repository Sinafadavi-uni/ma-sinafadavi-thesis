## Main Idea Under Evaluation

### Vector Clock-Based Causal Consistency with Capability Awareness

**Description**: Implement vector clocks enhanced with node capability information for maintaining causal consistency across distributed operations. Use capability-weighted conflict resolution, energy-aware clock synchronization frequency, and causal ordering for job execution dependencies.

**Key Components**:
- **Broker Replication**: Vector clocks for causal ordering of broker metadata updates
- **Executor Recovery**: Capability-aware causal consistency for job state management
- **Datastore Replication**: Causal consistency with happens-before relationships for data operations

**Based on**: 
- "Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System" - https://doi.org/10.1145/359545.359563
- "Causal Consistency for Geo-Replicated Cloud Storage" - https://doi.org/10.1145/2911151.2911160
