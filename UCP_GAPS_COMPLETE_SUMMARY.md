- **Solution**: CrossBrokerDeduplicationManager with enhanced FCFS and resurrection tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Enhanced FCFS policy with cross-broker coordination
  - ExecutorResurrectionTracker: Tracks failed and resurrected executors
  - Result provenance tracking (which broker/executor produced result)
  - Duplicate result detection and rejection
  - Cross-broker result coordination and conflict resolution

### **Gap 4: Configurable Replication Policies** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **File**: `rec/Phase4_UCP_Integration/configurable_replication_policies.py`

- **Solution**: ConfigurableReplicationManager with policy-driven data classification
- **Key Features**:
  - ReplicationPolicyEngine: Manages multiple replication strategies
  - Multiple storage tiers (memory, local_disk, network_disk, archive)
  - Data categories with different replication needs
  - TTL-based data lifecycle management
  - Policy-driven routing and storage decisions
